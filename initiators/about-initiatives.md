# About Initiatives

### Who can propose an initiative?

As log as you are part of the SUTD community (past or present), you are welcomed to submit an initiative!

{% hint style="info" %}
If you aren't from the SUTD community but believe that you have an initiative that might still benefit SUTD, feel free to hit us up and we'll take a look!
{% endhint %}

### What kind of initiatives can I propose?

If you can think of it, you can propose it. The only conditions are that your projects can contribute to the overall SUTD community in some way, shape, or form. Some examples could be an academic project like building an arcade machine where you open source the schematics and the code after you are done building. It could also be raising funds for a fifth-row bonding session. Or taking an online course about organisational structures and making a tutorial/guide on it.&#x20;

But keep in mind, the community will be the one voting on which projects they like. So the more you can contribute to the community, the more likely your initiative will get funded!
