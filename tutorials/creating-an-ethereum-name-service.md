# Creating an Ethereum Name Service

### What is an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and why is it useful?

{% hint style="info" %}
**tl;dr:** ENS helps map 0x49c6a7f9F3755C810d5DDFaf029817742C46BE2b to sutdaa.eth to make it easy to remember and identify

Traditionally, an Ethereum address is a very long string of random characters that looks like this: 0x49c6a7f9F3755C810d5DDFaf029817742C46BE2b.This address is pretty difficult to remember and is not easily identifiable. You can register your wallet address to an ENS like sutdaa.eth which creates a two way mapping between your wallet address and your short name. This means that you can now interact with smart contracts with your shortened name. Think of it as instead of having to type in 69.171.250.35 (Facebook’s ip address) in your browser every time you want to rant about your terrible day, all you need to do is type in facebook.com which then reroutes you to the same Facebook page.

We want to use ENS so that it becomes easier to identify which projects belong to which addresses. For example, if a supporter wants to identify

### How to create an ENS?

* Firstly, you need an address to call your own. This can be done simply by creating a metamask account. If you haven't already done so, go look at our previous tutorial!
* Your account needs to be funded with a little test ETH. You can follow this faucet tutorial if you are testnet broke.
* Navigate to https://app.ens.domains/ and click the connect button on the top left. Make sure that your metamask account has already been switched to the Ropsten Test Network before connecting!

* The site will prompt you to connect with your ethereum wallet. Click on metamask and select your account

* Once you have connected, you should notice the top left now says Ropsten Network, along with your wallet address

* Search the name you want in the Search Bar

* Click on the name that appears after you search

* If you get the page below, it means that the name has already been taken. Go back to the previous page and search for another one!

* If you get the page below, that means you can register this name as yours!

![Go ahead and start registering your ENS](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XflCqDgVAGapPM9IwP2U6dxZyUG7bOceb-6JUGbdtIKcT80Qp7ClzlJM6QzTKzAcqgg3gpseQ93hYvmHFi2f4\_BxU8BkwS\_O8q5zTe1L\_\_j\_PDALS9AumWWNxfQusBI\_haaQ2jWG=s1600)

* Change the number of years if you want. The longer it is the longer you can keep the name for, but the more test ETH it will cost. Click on request to register when you’re ready.
* A metamask transaction should pop up. Click `confirm`
* Wait for the transaction to be confirmed

* Once done, you should start to see the green bar fill. Wait for a minute

* When the green bar stops moving, the register button should light up blue. Click on `register`

* A second transaction should pop up. Go ahead and confirm it.
* Click on `set reverse record`

* Select your newly created ENS in the drop down menu and click save

* Again, confirm the metamask transaction
* You should see this message saying that the reverse record was set. And you’re done! You can now use your ENS and your address interchangeably.
