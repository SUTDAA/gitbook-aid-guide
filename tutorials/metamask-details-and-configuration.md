1. This is the network that you are currently using. You can switch between networks anytime.&#x20;
2. This displays your wallet address. This is the address that people will use to transfer tokens to you.&#x20;
3. This tells you whether or not your Metamask is connected to the website you are currently on.&#x20;
4. This shows you how much ETH you have in your account. You will need some ETH to make transactions.

**IMPORTANT: Change the network to Ropsten if you want to interact with AID tokens**

AA-Aid does not use the Ethereum Mainnet, but instead uses the Ropsten Test Network, which means all tokens and Ether are not real. You will not be able to convert anything on the testnet to real cash, so donâ€™t try it. But this also means that all transaction fees will be free!
