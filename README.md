# Vision and Objectives

## Our Vision

To create an ecosystem that we are proud to be a part of by amplifying the best of SUTD's culture.

## Our mission

To empower members of SUTD's ecosystem to inspire, grow, and sustain our community's projects.

## Our Objectives

As members of the SUTD community, we are taught to design and build innovative products, to dive in and explore things that interest us, and to use our knowledge to creatively problem-solve. Unsurprisingly, a common blocker that many of us face is a lack of funding. In order to foster a greater culture of exploration and building, the SUTD Alumni Association has came up with AA-Aid - an open-source platform that supports SUTD's growing ecosystem through project funding.

This platform aims to solve the common issues of project funding, namely, accountability, transparency, and longevity. As donors ourselves, we understand how futile it might feel to donate to a cause and not know what your money might be used for, or how much of it even went towards the cause. On the project side, many projects simply become one and done, with throwaway final products, destined to be repeated by a different group of juniors down the road.

## Our Values

#### Transparency

_Transparency underpins trust._

The allocation of project donations and support must be done in a completely transparent manner. AA-Aid will connect project initiators (project managers, event organisers, fifth row leaders, etc) with supporters (literally anyone willing to contribute!).&#x20;

Gone are the days that you simply donate a lump sum and leave the organisation to manage it. You can allocate your funds and support personally.

#### Accountability

_Trust, but verify._

Every project that seeks support must be held accountable to its supporters. This principle will be upheld through clear and simple processes on how funds may be disbursed and tracked. Project are held accountable by ensuring alignment in proposed activities with stated objectives and by ensuring project files are archived and accessible.
