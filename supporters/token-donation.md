# Token Donation

{% hint style="info" %}
**Flexible:** This will be slightly more complicated, but you get a lot more flexibility!
{% endhint %}

Unlike the cash donation, this method allows you to keep the tokens in your personal wallet. This means that you can donate to any project whenever you want to and see it instantly credited to the project. Plus, you get a chance to learn how to perform a smart contract transaction!

1. Make sure you have a metamask address. If you do not know how to create one, you can follow the step-by-step tutorial.
2. Top up tokens by transferring the amount you want to donate to the SUTDAA QR code. (Please round your donation up to the nearest dollar)
3. In the transfer description, please include your address or Ethereum Name Service (ENS)
4. Once the donation is processed, tokens of an equivalent amount will be transferred to your metamask wallet.
5. You can view your AID tokens in the right hand corner of the website once you connect your wallet
6. You can now browse through projects and donate any amount of your tokens to any listed project.
7. You can check the amount donated along with your name on the project page after the transaction is processed.
